                Spider-Man redefined what a superhero could be, and although many have followed in his footsteps, he's
                still
                number one, definitively at Marvel and arguably anywhere else.

                Today you can still tell a Spider-Man story about the awkward teen learning to exist in a world of adult
                superheroes and villains, while also telling a story about the Peter Parker who's been married and a
                father, or a corporate CEO, or in the animated Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and the MCU's
                Spider-Man: No Way Home, a mentor to a younger Spider-Man.

            </header>
            <p class="card__lead">
                Captain America is a quintessential part of the Marvel Universe, but it took decades for him to reach
                that potential.
            </p>
            <p class="class__quote">
                Chris Evans' portrayal of Cap in MCU films over 60 years after the character's creation only raised his
                stature further. While comic book Captain America is still as young and vital as always, Evan's
                live-action Cap will cast a shadow over the MCU for years to come, as evidenced by 2021's The Falcon &
                Winter Soldier Disney Plus streaming series and lingering rumors of Evan's return in some form or
                another.

            <p class="card__lead">
                Strong women have been a mainstay of Marvel Comics - particularly in the X-Men - and Storm, without a
                doubt, is one of the strongest and hardest to break.

            <p class="class__quote">
                While her mutant ability to control the weather is a pivotal part of her, thanks to the writers and
                artists that have added layers to her character, it's Storm the woman and her often dueling qualities of
                tenacity, anger, forgiveness, and compassion.

            </header>
            <p class="card__lead">
                Wolverine is the ultimate brooding loner. Combine that with a gritty tenacity and knives on (and in!)
                his hands, and you have a unique superhero cut from a very different cloth than those who came before
                him - who has carved himself a niche that countless characters have since tried to occupy.
            </p>
            <p class="class__quote">
                Wolverine's catchphrase is 'The best there is at what he does.' And that's proven to be true, over and
                over again as imitators, variants, and clones (sometimes metaphorically, sometimes literally) come and
                go.

            </header>
            <p class="card__lead">
                The Black Panther is a different brand of superhero than most because he not only wears a heroic mantle,
                but also a crown; a crown that carries with it the weight of an entire nation.
            </p>
            <p class="class__quote">
                The Black Panther sits in a unique place at Marvel - as the king of a nation who has recently realized
                that his own monarchy is at odds with democracy and the equal rights of his subjects, but who is still
                trying to find better ways to contribute to his home nation and Marvel's world at large.
